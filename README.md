MicroPython Edge
=======================
This fork is created for the reason that [The MicroPython Project](https://github.com/micropython/micropython) has always been reluctant to introduce new features due to corcerns about consistency across platforms.

For those who do not share the same concern and want to **SQUEEZE OUT EVERY LAST BIT OF JUICE** from your microcontroller, you are welcome to try out this fork!

This experimental version of MicroPython aims at bringing the newest and most wholesome vendor-speicific features to your device while mantaining basic(common module level) compatibility with the official MicroPython.


Building
---------------------
Please refer to the standard [MicroPython document](README_mp.md)


Features
-----------------
##### ESP32: More Options in CPU Frequency Setting
```py
import machine
machine.freq(1) # set CPU frequency to 1MHz
```
* Available frequencies: 1MHz, 2MHz, 4MHz , 8MHz, 10MHz, 20MHz, 40MHz, 80MHz, 160MHz, 240MHz.
* WIFI relies on 40MHz XTAL clock. When setting frequency<=40MHz, XTAL clock will supply CPU frequency, wifi will therefore be unuseable.

##### ESP32: Power Management(WIP)
```py
import esp32
esp32.wifi_power_save(esp32.WIFI_PS_MAX_MODEM) # set wifi power save mode to maximum
```

##### ESP32: Support for GPIO Pin Hold/Drive 
```py
import machine
p=machine.Pin(10)
p.init(drive=p.DRIVE_CAP_STRONGEST, hold=True)
```
* Setting Pin hold will also enable RTCIO Pin hold(if current pin is initialized as a RTCIO pin).
* Pin drive sets the output current limit of current pin. (Strongest â‰ˆ 80mA) [ref1](https://twitter.com/eMbeddedHome/status/868787870743629825)
* For additional details, please refer to [vendor docs](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/api-reference/peripherals/gpio.html#_CPPv212gpio_hold_en10gpio_num_t).

##### ESP8266/ESP32: Support for ESP-Now
To get a overview of the ESP-Now protocol, checkout the [official user guide](https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp-now_user_guide_en.pdf) first.

Miminal Example:
```py
import network
w = network.WLAN(network.AP_IF) # doesn't matter if AP or STA
w.active(True)
w.config(channel=1) # do make sure all devices are on the same channel
print('self mac addr:', w.config('mac'))

def tx(result):
  mac, sent = result
  print("send: %s - %r" % (mac,sent))
def rx(result):
  mac, msg = result
  print("recv: %s - %s" % (mac,msg))

PEER_MAC1 = b'0\xad\xa3?>\x98'
PEER_MAC2 = b'b\x02\x95)\xda\x8c'

from esp import espnow
espnow.init()
espnow.on_send(tx)
espnow.on_recv(rx)
espnow.pmk('0123456789abcdef')
espnow.add_peer(PEER_MAC1, "1111222233334444")
espnow.add_peer(PEER_MAC2)
espnow.send(PEER_MAC1, 'hello encrypted peer')
espnow.send(PEER_MAC2, 'hello unencrypted peer')
espnow.send(None, "hello all peers")
```

Since ESP-Now library is distributed in binary by Espressif, there isn't much I can do to fix issues/bugs reside with the library ... and there are a lot of them.

Some bugs and caveats you might have encounter when using ESP-Now: ()
* Upon changing the primary key(pmk), all local peers' local keys(lmk) have to be re-applied. Otherwise the system will continue to use the old encryption setup by the previous pmk.
* Device who add peer with lmk can still receive unencrypted message from the added peer
* There is no get lmk from peer because of bugs in the SDK.


##### ESP32: Support For More Sleep Options
Light Sleep: [ref](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/api-reference/system/sleep_modes.html#entering-light-sleep)
```py
import machine
machine.sleep(ms)
```

New Wakeup Source: [ref](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/api-reference/system/sleep_modes.html#ulp-coprocessor-wakeup)
```py
import esp32
esp32.sleep_pd_config(esp32.PD_DOMAIN_RTC_PERIPH, esp32.ESP_PD_OPTION_AUTO)
esp32.wake_on_ulp(True) # enable ULP coprocessor to wake up the device

esp32.lightsleep_wake_on_gpio(True) # wake on gpio, pin(s) are set using machine.Pin.init()
esp32.lightsleep_wake_on_uart(True) # wake up when input data is available on uart
```

* ULP wakeup source can not be used when RTC_PERIPH power domain is forced to be powered on (ESP_PD_OPTION_ON) or when ext0 wakeup source is used. [ref](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/api-reference/system/sleep_modes.html#_CPPv227esp_sleep_enable_ulp_wakeupv)
* ULP coprocessor can not be disabled for wake_on_ulp() to work.
